In this series of articles, we will explore the recent advancements in generative modeling and uncover the theoretical foundations behind these developments. Each article will build upon the previous one, creating a clear roadmap through the evolving landscape of generative models. The series will cover the following topics:

[1. Introduction](/generative_series/introduction/)

[2. Diffusion Model](/generative_series/diffusion_model/)
