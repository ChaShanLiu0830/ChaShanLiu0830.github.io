Hi, This Evan! I am currently a machine learning researcher specializing in cutting-edge generative models. In this blog, I share research papers and topics that pique my interest. Alongside my professional work, I am also an amateur photographer, capturing the world through my lens.

I hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in theoretical physics from National Tsing Hua University. I have also worked as a research assistant at National Taiwan University, focusing on reinforcement learning. Over the past two years, I have been deeply involved in machine learning, particularly in analyzing and working with financial data.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn for more updates and professional insights.
